# ARCHITECTURE
# - Top-level keys are migration base plugin IDs. This improves both maintainability and performance.
# - For each migration base plugin ID, an array of possible message matches can be specified. Each is evaluated in order
#   and as soon as a match is found, the subsequent ones are not evaluated.
# - For each possible message match, at minimum a `regexp` and a `generic_solution` must be specified.
# - Optional: more granular suggestions are possible by specifying a "named capture group"
#   (syntax: `(?<name>EXPRESSION)`) and specifying that named group in the `specific_solution_per` key. This enables
#   `specific_solution`. If a `generic_solution` is specified, this is considered the fallback.
# - Optional: even more granular solutions are possible by also specifying the `computed_specific_solution` key and
#   setting the `callback` and `args` subkeys. This allows one to compute a solution per `specific_solution_per` value.
#   Currently, the following callbacks are supported:
#   1. `source_db_table_row_has_empty_column`, possible outcomes: `is_empty`, `is_not_empty`
#   2. `source_db_table_row_has_null_column`, possible outcomes: `is_null`, `is_not_null`
#   3. `source_db_table_row_exists`, possible outcomes: `exists`, `does_not_exist`
#
# There is no validation yet. There is no UI for this yet. This is designed to require as little custom code as
# possible and to maximally reuse existing concepts.
#
# Plenty of examples to be found below!

    message:

        This is a regular expression that the message must match. The opening and closing delimiters are slashes. Apply
        the corresponding necessary escaping for the regular expression. If there are identifiers that determine the
        appropriate solution, capture them using `(<some_identifier>EXPRESSION)`.

        In YAML, multi-line strings are supported as well. Any newlines are converted to spaces automatically, so this
        text will not trigger a newline. And here again backslashes do NOT need to be escaped.
