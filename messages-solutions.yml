# ARCHITECTURE
# - Top-level keys are migration base plugin IDs. This improves both maintainability and performance.
# - For each migration base plugin ID, an array of possible message matches can be specified. Each is evaluated in order
#   and as soon as a match is found, the subsequent ones are not evaluated.
# - For each possible message match, at minimum a `regexp` and a `generic_solution` must be specified.
# - Optional: more granular suggestions are possible by specifying a "named capture group"
#   (syntax: `(?<name>EXPRESSION)`) and specifying that named group in the `specific_solution_per` key. This enables
#   `specific_solution`. If a `generic_solution` is specified, this is considered the fallback.
# - Optional: even more granular solutions are possible by also specifying the `computed_specific_solution` key and
#   setting the `callback` and `args` subkeys. This allows one to compute a solution per `specific_solution_per` value.
#   Currently, the following callbacks are supported:
#   1. `source_db_table_row_has_empty_column`, possible outcomes: `is_empty`, `is_not_empty`
#   2. `source_db_table_row_has_null_column`, possible outcomes: `is_null`, `is_not_null`
#   3. `source_db_table_row_exists`, possible outcomes: `exists`, `does_not_exist`
#
# There is no validation yet. There is no UI for this yet. This is designed to require as little custom code as
# possible and to maximally reuse existing concepts.
#
# Plenty of examples to be found below!
